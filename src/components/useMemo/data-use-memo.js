In the function we need to return the desired value (in below case the colors array). If useMemo is being called again (when the App is being re-rendered), but the values in the dependencies array haven't changed, useMemo will return the previous array. And if one of the dependency values has changed, then useMemo will call the function again. In a way, useMemo works like a cache, and only a dependency value change can break it.",
